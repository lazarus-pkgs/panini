/* panosphere.h		for Panini 29 Jan 2009 TKS

    Arrays of vertices on the unit sphere and their
    2D texture coordinates for various projections,
    plus arrays of linear indices that map the
    vertices to line segments and quadrilaterals.

    The sphere is subdivided starting from the corners
    of the inscribed cube whose faces are centered on
    the coordinate axes.  The number of subdivisions
    along each cube edge, divs, is the c'tor argument.
    divs will be rounded up to the next even number if
    odd.  There are 6 * divs * divs quads in the final
    tesselation.

    The vertices are unit 3-vectors, and are also the
    normals OGL needs to generate cubic texture
    coordinates.
