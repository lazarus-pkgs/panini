At version 0.6, pvQt has been renamed "Panini".
Update 0.61 (SVN 77) fixes some UI bugs. It uses native 
file selector dialogs on Windows and OSX because some
Mac users have reported difficulty with the Qt dialog.
Update 0.62 adds the ability to make Pannini views from
cubic panoramas, and to control alignment of the image 
on the pancylinder.  

Update 0.63 adds persistent settings, including the
last-used window size and a Mac-specific limit on the 
size of cubic images.

This is a beta release of software that is under active
development and will be replaced by a better version in
the not-too-distant future.  So you should expect to find
some bugs.  Please report those, either on the hugin-et-al
discussion group:
http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx
or the pvQt project's bug tracker at SourceForge:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=241632&atid=1116683

The main new features in version 0.6 are:
-- cylindrical panosurface enables "Panini projection" for
   convincing perspective effects in wide angle views (not 
   available for cubic source images).
-- The range of eye distance has been enlarged and the 
   controls for it linearized.  It is now possible to sweep 
   the viewing projection from linear through stereographic
   or Panini, all the way to sinusoidal.
-- There are presets for the 3 principal viewing projections.
-- framing controls shift view center with respect to screen
   window.
-- can shift eye point sideways as well as radially, for
   "software view camera" effects.

Some other improvements
-- fewer errors in input deprojection functions (some 
   still need work)
-- a bug in cubic picture loading has ben fixed.

Update 0.61 adds these bug fixes and UI improvements:
-- The menu for choosing source image format is now titled "Source" (was "Picture")
-- You can choose to see the wire frame panosphere models instead of an image
-- Panocylinder is automatically selected for non-cubic source formats; so just hit
   "P" to see the Pannini projection.
-- The current panosurface type is always displayed correctly
-- All window titles now say "Panini"
-- The program has a nice icon that shows a pano of the Erasmus bridge in Rotterdam, 
   that was perspective-corrected with Panini.

Update 0.62 adds these enhancements:
-- Pannini projections of cubic panoramas can now be displayed.
-- Angular alignment of the image on the panosurface can be adjusted via a new "Turn" dialog.  For cubic panos only, Yaw and pitch can be set to put the axis of the panosurface anywhere in the spherical image.
-- Panosurface is now selected by clicking a button at bottom of window.  Another such button cycles through the non-cubic input projections.  Menu items for these have been removed.
-- Mouse control can be made vertical-only by holding Alt. or horizontal-only by holding Control.  This may not work on Linux, depending on X11 option setup.
-- Framing shifts are displayed on status line, and reset along with eye shifts.
-- More errors in the input mappings have been fixed.

Update 0.63 addds two persistent settings:
-- window size is saved at shutdown and restored at launch.  The initial default size is now smaller to accommodate the small wide-format screens on some newer laptops.
-- cubic image resolution is limited on Macs to solve an OSX bug that causes garbled display or even system crashes with large cubic texture maps.  The default limit of 1536 x 1536 (13.5 megapixels) should work on many recent Macs, but if yours needs a smaller limit, or you want to push the limit higher, you can change it via "cube size" in the Presets menu.

Known issues and limitations:
-- Cubic pano load fails unpredicatably on some OSX systems.
   If you are a Mac graphics expert, please help debug this!
-- on OSX, after a failed cubic load, no cubic pano can be
   loaded until Panini is restarted.
-- on OSX, cancelling a qtvr load may cause subsequent loads
   to fail.
-- Displayed vFov angle is correct only for the panosphere
   and eye distances between 0 and 1.
-- still does not read PT scripts/projects
-- To save high resolution views, your OpenGL must support 
off-screen framebuffers of arbitrary size. 

There are no longer any test images in the souce code package.
A set of test images, all made from one spherical panorama, 
is available for download as a separate package.

The win32 binary package has been built with Qt 4.4.3, and
contains executable Qt libraries from that version.  But
Qt version 4.4.1+ is probably sufficient.
