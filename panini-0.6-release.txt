At version 0.6, pvQt has been renamed "panini".

This is a beta release of software that is under active
development and will be replaced by a better version in
the not-too-distant future.  So you should expect to find
some bugs.  Please report those, either on the hugin-et-al
discussion group:
http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx
or the pvQt project's bug tracker at SourceForge:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=241632&atid=1116683
You may find a newer release at:

The main new features are:
-- cylindrical panosurface enables "Panini projection" for
   convincing perspective effects in wide angle views (not 
   available for cubic source images).
-- The range of eye distance has been enlarged and the 
   controls for it linearized.  It is now possible to sweep 
   the viewing projection from linear through stereographic
   or Panini, all the way to orthographic or cylindrical.
-- There are presets for the 3 principal viewing projections.
-- framing controls shift view center with respect to screen
   window.
-- can shift eye point sideways as well as radially, for
   "software view camera" effects.

Some other improvements
-- fewer errors in input deprojection functions (some 
   still need work)
-- a bug in cubic picture loading has ben fixed.

Known issues and limitations:
-- Displayed vFov angle is correct only for the panosphere
   and eye distances between 0 and 1.
-- Vertical scale and aspect ratio at picture center change
   with eye distance.  You can fix this with view controls, 
   but there should be some automatic compensation.
-- Initial vertical scale on panocylinder is too high.
-- still does not read PT scripts/projects
-- Can't display cylindrical views of cubic sources
-- To save high resolution views, your OpenGL must support 
off-screen framebuffers of arbitrary size. 

I have prepared a set of test images, made from the same 
spherical panoramic view, that you can use to verify the
correctness (or lack thereof) of the projections.  It is
available for download as a separate package.

The win32 binary package has been built with Qt 4.4.3, and
contains executable Qt libraries from that version.  But
Qt version 4.4.1+ is probably sufficient.
