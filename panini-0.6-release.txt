With version 0.6, pvQt has been renamed "panini".

This is a beta release of software that is under active
development and will be replaced by a better version in
the not-too-distant future.  So you should expect to find
some bugs.  Please report those, either on the hugin-et-al
discussion group:
http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx
or the pvQt project's bug tracker at SourceForge:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=241632&atid=1116683

Release 0.6 is basically pvQt 0.5 with the addition of an 
alternate cylindrical panosurface and some new viewing 
controls.  But with the Panini projection, it is no longer 
just a wacky panorama viewer, but the beginnings of a serious 
tool for creating printable wide angle photographs. 

The main new features are:
-- cylindrical panosurface enables "Panini projection" for
   convincing perspective effects in wide angle views (not 
   available for cubic source images)
-- framing controls shift view center with respect to screen
   window.
-- can shift eye point sideways as well as radially, for
   "software view camera" effects.

Some other improvements
-- fewer errors in input deprojection functions (some 
   still need work)

Known issues and limitations:
-- still does not read PT scripts/projects
-- Can't display cylindrical views of cubic sources
-- To save high resolution views, your OpenGL must support 
off-screen framebuffers of arbitrary size. 

I have prepared a set of test images, made from the same 
spherical panoramic view, that you can use to verify the
correctness (or lack thereof) of the projections.  It is
available for download as a separate package.

The win32 binary package has been built with Qt 4.4.3, and
contains executable Qt libraries from that version.  But
Qt version 4.4.1+ is probably sufficient.
