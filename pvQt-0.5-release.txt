This is a beta release of software that is under active
development and will be replaced by a better version in
the not-too-distant future.  So you should expect to find
some bugs.  Please report those, either on the hugin-et-al
discussion group:
http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx
or the pvQt project's bug tracker at SourceForge:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=241632&atid=1116683

Release 0.5 is a fairly extensive rework of 0.4, in particular
the mouse and keyboard controls are different; so current as
well as new users should read pvQt-usage.txt for this release.

The main new features are:
-- can load images (including cube faces) by drag-and-drop
-- can save the view as a high resolution jpeg
-- can adjust the apparent angular size of loaded images
-- two more projections: mercator and stereographic

Some other improvements
-- image scales and displayed FOVs are more likely to be
correct (a few cases still need work)
-- can load images with fields of view too big to be
displayed (the excess is clipped)
-- can zoom with the scroll wheel, if your mouse has one

Known issues and limitations:
-- still does not read PT scripts/projects
-- image scaling is somewhat wrong for some projections, in
particular stereographic, the vertical axis of mercator, and
the vertical axis of cylindrical QTVRs.  But all are usable.
-- To save high resolution views, your OpenGL must support 
off-screen framebuffers of arbitrary size.  If it does not,
views are saved at screen resolution.

I have prepared a set of test images, made from the same 
spherical panoramic view, that you can use to verify the
correctness (or lack thereof) of the projections.  It is
available for download as a separate package only.

The win32 binary package has been built with Qt 4.4.3, and
contains the executable Qt libraries from that version.
Earlier releases used Qt version 4.4.1.
